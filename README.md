It is written in C++17 without external requirements.
You can compile the program `repair-inplace` with a recent GCC version and `make`.
You can change the compile flags for a release or debug build in the `Makefile`.
Running the program `repair-inplace` without parameters displays its parameters and its usage.
Add `-DVERBOSE` and `-DVVERBOSE` to enhance verbose or very verbose messages, outputting, among others, the created rules.

The program `repair-inplace` takes as input a file, and treats this file as a byte stream.
So the input alphabet size is the byte alphabet.
We simplified the implementation in that we store the input in a 16-bit array of fixed size.
Hence, the program works whenever the sum of all different terminals and non-terminal is at most 2^16.
It is easy to enhance the program with a dynamic resizing of the bit width of the text by using an integer vector supporting dynamic bit widths like the `IntVector` of [bit span](https://github.com/tudocomp/bit_span).
We refrained from adding this feature as the program is already very slow, taking already one hour for computing Re-Pair on 1 MiB text files.
This slow running time looks inevitable, as the algorithm described in the paper takes O(n^2) time, at it looks likely that this time bound is tight.
We did not implement the word-packed variant described in the paper, as the number of involved operations seem to make the algorithm actually slower.

As this is a proof-of-concept implementation, it lacks crucial features:

* there is no output - however you can extract the rules and the start symbol from the log messages
* there is no decompression verifying that the text is restorable from the output
* the code is far from optimized (see the CAVEAT comments)
